# This is my .vimrc

I'm usually working with Python/Django and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so my Vim IDE is configured for these languages.

All of the plugins are installed and updated via [Pathogen](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)!

Have fun and fork at will! :)

# Quick start

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/lambacck/vimconfig.git ~/.vim` - **Be careful not to override your own configuration...**
2. Initialize the [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) plugin as a sub-repository:

        git submodule init
        git submodule update


**Enjoy!** :)
